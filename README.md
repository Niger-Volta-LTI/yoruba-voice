In 2022, we launched the curation and recording of 40 hours of high-fidelity speech data for the Yorùbá language, the third most widely spoken language in Africa with over 40 million L1 speakers. We partner with the [YorubaName](https://www.yorubaname.com/) organization in Nigeria to encourage volunteers both online and offline to record their voices.
